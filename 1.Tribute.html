          <h2>Missile Men of India</h2>
          <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace
            scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India
            from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram,
            Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
            the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
            mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
            and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
            involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile
            development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of
            India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
            launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
